# Solemskogen Atlas

The Solemskogen Atlas is an interactive map aiming to chart artworks created on Wplace as part of Solemskogen City. Because Wplace is ongoing (unlike r/place), making it difficult to maintain a clean canvas, it is focused on art in the [SEAL template collection](https://seal.hakase.life).

Its code is based on [the r/place 2023 Atlas](https://github.com/placeAtlas/atlas-2023), whose code in turn was established by Roland Rytz for r/place 2017 and further developed and maintained by the [Place Atlas Initiative](https://place-atlas.stefanocoding.me) and [its contributors](https://github.com/placeAtlas/atlas-2023/graphs/contributors). Like the original, this project is licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](LICENSE).
